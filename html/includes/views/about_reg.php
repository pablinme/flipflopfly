        	<h1> <small> What is Flipflopfly ? </small> </h1>
        	<p>Flipflopfly is a comunity that allows you to see who is traveing and ask them to bring you something or tell them you are willing to bring something when you are traveling.</p>
            <p>have you ever had a friend bring you something from abroad? have you ever brought something for a friend? It’s an amazing way to get good deals and to deepen your bond.</p>
			<p>The only problem is that you can only ask someone you know, but people are most of the time willing to help eachother out when they can. What if you could know about more people traveling?</p>
            <p>Now you can! Reach to a wide number of travelers, help eachother out and make new friends!</p>
			<p>As a self moderating community flipflopfly’s users will rate eachother according to favors done one another.</p>
            <p>Flipflopfly does not make any profit from any form of exchange between users. It is a community of people willing to give a helping hand whenever possible.</p>
